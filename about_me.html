    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        I’m Emma Smith—an American creative currently living in Tokyo, blending coffee, code, and couture into a life I’m proud to call my own. By day, I serve lattes with a side of charm. By night, I bring garments to life with a needle, a vision, and far too many fabric scraps on my floor.
<br>
        My background in web design gives me a strong digital foundation, but I thrive when I’m hands-on—cutting patterns, experimenting with texture, or pushing the limits of upcycled fashion.
<br>
        In quieter moments, you’ll find me nose-deep in a murder mystery novel or scaling indoor rock walls to clear my head. I’ve also seen every episode of Doctor Who at least twice (yes, even the ones from the ‘60s), and I firmly believe that a sonic screwdriver and a sewing machine have more in common than most people think.
<br>
        I value curiosity, craftsmanship, and courage—the kind it takes to start over in a new country, follow your creative instincts, and carve a life out of passion.
